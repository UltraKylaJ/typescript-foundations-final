// In the index.ts file, import the class and generate four new users. 
//      You can give them any names.
// Add each of the users to an array when they are created.
// Print all the user information using the prettyPrint function by using the forEach loop on the array.
// Write tests to verify that the methods and classes within your program behave as expected.
